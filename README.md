# U.S. Airline Flight Delays - Data Visualization Project

## Dataset

This project explores approximately 2 million U.S. domestic flight records from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' **Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance** database. The dataset includes information about carriers, airports, scheduled and actual times, delay durations, and delay causes.

## Project Structure

- `Part_I_exploration.ipynb` - Exploratory data analysis with 9 visualizations
- `Part_I_exploration.html` - HTML export of Part I
- `Part_II_explanatory.ipynb` - Explanatory analysis with 4 polished visualizations
- `Part_II_explanatory.html` - HTML export of Part II

## Key Findings

1. Most flights arrive on time or early, but delays follow predictable patterns
2. Delays cascade throughout the day -- early morning flights are the most reliable
3. Late aircraft delays (cascading schedule disruptions) are the largest systemic cause
4. Summer and winter months have the highest delay rates due to weather

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
